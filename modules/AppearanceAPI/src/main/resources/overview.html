        Appearance API/SPI controls the visual <b>transformations</b> that can
        be applied to nodes and edges.
        <p>
            API provides access to the various functions that can be applied to
            elements. Functions can be simple (e.g. unique color to all nodes)
            but also based on a ranking for numerical sorted attributes or a
            partition for categorical attributes.

            See <code>org.gephi.appearance.spi</code> package to know how to define
            new transformers.
